# bark ? woof woof ? bark ?

you can run something like nmtui with
`:run foot nmtui`

eventually you will be able to run a desktop file with
`:<desktop-file-exec-name>`

this is basically just a project to learn more in-depth on how writing renderers and how the wayland protocol works. it runs pretty badly. im using it to learn how to optimize C code.

please employ me
